# Project Overview

This project consists of four simple Bash scripts. It will give beginners an idea of the things that can be achieved with bash scripts.  Some of the scripts use`for` loops and `while` loops. Each script performs a specific task and can be executed independently.

## Look out for more complex scripts in the near-future!
